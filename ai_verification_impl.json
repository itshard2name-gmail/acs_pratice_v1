{"title":"High Score Leaderboard Sort","description":"# Problem Description\n\nWrite a program that processes a list of player high scores and sorts them to generate a leaderboard. Each entry consists of a player's name (String) and their score (Integer).\n\nThe leaderboard must be sorted according to the following two rules:\n\n1. **Primary Sort:** Entries must be sorted primarily by **Score** in **descending** order (highest score first).\n2. **Secondary Sort (Tie-breaker):** If two or more entries have the same score, they must be sorted by **Player Name** in **ascending** alphabetical order (A-Z).\n\n## Input\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer $N$ (the number of player entries, $1 \\le N \\le 50$).\n\nThe following $N$ lines each contain a player entry, consisting of a string (the player name, containing no spaces) followed by an integer (the score, $0 \\le \\text{Score} \\le 1000$).\n\n## Output\n\nOutput the $N$ entries, sorted according to the rules described, one entry per line. Each line should contain the Player Name followed by a space, followed by the Score.","test_cases":[{"input":"4\nAlice 150\nBob 200\nCharlie 150\nDavid 200","output":"Bob 200\nDavid 200\nAlice 150\nCharlie 150","is_sample":true},{"input":"5\nZelda 100\nLink 500\nGanondorf 100\nNavi 500\nSheik 300","output":"Link 500\nNavi 500\nSheik 300\nGanondorf 100\nZelda 100","is_sample":false},{"input":"3\nTestPlayer 42\nAlpha 42\nBeta 42","output":"Alpha 42\nBeta 42\nTestPlayer 42","is_sample":false}]}
