# Agent Rules & Workflow Protocol

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Git Merge Policy
**ALL Agents MUST follow this rule strictly:**

1.  **NEVER merge to `main` without explicit user approval.**
2.  Work flow:
    - Create a Feature Branch (`feature/xyz`).
    - Implement and Verify changes.
    - **STOP and Ask User** for permission to merge.
    - ONLY after getting explicit "Yes" or "Approved", merge to `main`.

## General Guidelines
- Check `TASK.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` before starting work.
- Keep `TASK.md` updated as you progress.
